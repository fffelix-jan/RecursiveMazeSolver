 `mazeFilename` - The file name of the maze.  
 `startingX` - The starting X location.  
 `startingY` - The starting Y location.  
 `endingX` - The ending X location.  
 `endingY` - The ending Y location.  
 `show/hide` - The word "show" or "hide", which means whether or not you want to show the maze being solved in real time. (Optional)
